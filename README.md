# Movie-Recommender :smile:
 
- This can suggest top 5 movies being the most similar to the chosen test-movie
- Also, this compares results between using Sklearn and myCode. The results I got are exactly what I expected

## Usage :smile:

- Just try `python3 movie_recommender.py` in folder `src` (Oh note that you have to put the data on the right path)

## Results :smile:
